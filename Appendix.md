## Some examples of prompt tuning contribution to generated titles

We can find that prompt-tuning is more informative and natural than fine-tuning in these examples. Moreover, titles generated by prompt-tuning are more similar to ground truth titles (which can be found in the URL) than those generated by fine-tuning.
