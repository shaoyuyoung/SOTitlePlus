Debugging issue with Jekyll not properly updating static HTML or CSS files inside a Docker container. The issue is related to the use of layered file systems in Docker. The developer has added code to Static_file.rb to compare hashes, but the resulting hash does not match. The developer has tried using the FileUtils::cp method and shell cp command but only the latter works correctly. Ruby 2.2.3p173 and Linux containers are also being used. The developer has had to use a manual command instead of relying on Jekyll to build the files correctly. An interactive session with binding.pry shows that the FileUtils.cp method is not working correctly.

To convert the code to form_for or form_tag, you can try something like this:  Using form_for:  <%= form_for :title, url: '#', html: { onsubmit: 'foo(); return false;' } do |f| %>   <%# your form fields here %> <% end %>  Using form_tag:  <%= form_tag '#', onsubmit: 'foo(); return false;' do %>   <%# your form fields here %> <% end %>  Here, the "url" in form_for and "#" in form_tag are used to specify the URL where the form data will be submitted. Since you don't want to connect to another page, we use "#" to specify the current page.  The "html" option in form_for and "onsubmit" attribute in form_tag are used to attach the "foo()" function to the form submission event.  To prevent the default form submission behavior, we use "return false;" after calling the "foo()" function in both cases.

Fixing 'undefined method `on' for main:Object' error in Capistrano deployment  The error 'undefined method `on' for main:Object' in Capistrano deployment can be caused due to several reasons such as incorrect syntax, outdated gem version, and so on. You can try the following steps to fix the error:  1. Check the Capfile: Ensure that the Capfile is correctly written, and there are no syntax errors. Also, verify that all the required gems are included in the file, and their versions match the ones you are working with.  2. Update gem versions: Check if any of the required gems are outdated and update them to the latest version. You can run 'bundle update' to update all the gems.  3. Check RVM: Verify if RVM is installed correctly, and there are no issues with the RVM script. You can try reinstalling RVM or updating the RVM gem.  4. Check deploy.rb: Check the deploy.rb file for any errors or syntax issues. Ensure that all the required variables are correctly defined, such as the repo_url, application, domain, and user.  5. Check SSH key: Verify that the SSH key is correctly configured and has the necessary permissions to access the server. You can try adding the SSH key to the server again.  6. Try using a different gem: If the issue persists, you can try using a different version of the gem or a different gem entirely that provides the same functionality.  These steps should help you fix the 'undefined method `on' for main:Object' error in Capistrano deployment. If the issue persists, you can try contacting the gem developers or posting your issue on the Capistrano Github page for further assistance.

JSON integer values get converted to strings in request to API in Ruby on Rails.  The problem is that when sending a JSON request to the API, all the integer values within the JSON payload are converted to strings, which causes issues when validating and processing the data in the controller. Despite trying various solutions such as adding `format: :json` to the post action, the problem persists.  The code snippet shows the controller action and the test case where the issue occurs. The `ParametersValidator` class checks the structure and types of data in the request, and the `consider` action processes the data and returns a JSON response. However, all the integer values in the params get converted to strings, which causes issues in processing the data correctly.  The test case includes a JSON payload with integer values, but they get converted to strings in the params before being processed in the controller. The `binding.pry` statements are used to inspect the params before and after the post request to see the issue.  This problem needs to be resolved to ensure that the API can correctly process and validate JSON requests with integer values.

The output you are seeing is related to the use of strong parameters in Rails. This is a security feature that was introduced in Rails 4, which helps protect against mass assignment vulnerabilities.  The "hash-with-ivars" is a YAML format that includes instance variables that were present when the hash was serialized. In this case, it is related to the ActionController::Parameters object that is used to handle incoming parameters in Rails. The ivars: :@permitted: false indicates that the parameters have not yet been filtered through the strong parameters whitelist, so all parameters are currently permitted.  To use strong parameters, you typically define a private method in your controller that specifies the permitted parameters for each action. For example:  ``` def create   @post = Post.new(post_params)   # ... end  private  def post_params   params.require(:post).permit(:title, :body) end ```  In this example, the post_params method specifies that only the "title" and "body" parameters are permitted for the "post" object. When the create action is called with parameters, Rails will automatically filter out any parameters that are not in the whitelist. This helps prevent attackers from submitting additional, unauthorized parameters in an attempt to modify data that they should not have access to.

How to set a default value for a datetime field in ActiveAdmin  Solution:  To set the default value for a datetime field in ActiveAdmin, you can use the :default option of the input method. For example, to set the default value of :published_at to the current date and time, you can use the following code:  ActiveAdmin.register Post do   form do |f|     f.inputs "Post Details" do       f.input :title       f.input :body       f.input :published_at, as: :datetime, default: DateTime.now     end     f.actions   end end  In this code, we use the as: :datetime option to specify that the input should be a datetime field, and the default: DateTime.now option to set the default value to the current date and time.  Note that you can also set a default value for a datetime field by using a default value in the database schema, like this:  create_table :posts do |t|   t.string :title   t.text :body   t.datetime :published_at, default: -> { 'CURRENT_TIMESTAMP' } end  This sets the default value of :published_at to the current timestamp at the time the record is created, as determined by the database server. This approach doesn't require any changes to the ActiveAdmin form, as the default value is set at the database level.

Scope of In-line Disabling of Rubocop Rule  Context: Rubocop is a popular static code analysis tool used to enforce coding standards and ensure consistent code quality in Ruby projects. It comes with a large set of pre-defined rules, which may be added or customized to fit the specific requirements of the project.  Problem: When a Rubocop rule is disabled in-line, such as with the "# rubocop:disable" comment shown in the code snippet, it raises the question of whether that rule will be disabled for the rest of the file or for all subsequent files in the current scan.  Solution: The in-line disabling of a Rubocop rule is limited in scope to the current file only. It will not affect any subsequent files that are analyzed during the current scan, and the rule will be reactivated as soon as the current file is completed.  If you desire to disable a rule for multiple files, you will need to add the disabling comment to each of those files. Alternatively, you can add a custom configuration file (.rubocop.yml) to the project directory, and include the rule or rules that you want to disable. This will ensure that the rule is disabled for all files in the project directory.  In conclusion, a Rubocop rule that is disabled in-line is only disabled for the current file, and will not affect subsequent files analyzed during the current scan.

The deprecation warning is indicating that the method to_hash (which you may not be explicitly calling) is being used somewhere in your code and will be removed in Rails 5.1. In order to avoid potential security vulnerabilities, you should update your code to use one of the documented methods in ActionController::Parameters.  You can start by checking all instances where you are passing around or manipulating parameters, like in the code snippet you provided. Instead of using the merge method on the params object, you should use the permit method to filter and whitelist the parameters that are allowed to be passed through, like this:  link_to(name, { action: action_name, params: params.permit(:order) }, { title: "Sort by this field", })  You will need to update all instances of parameter handling in your codebase to use this new syntax.  It's also worth checking any gems or libraries that you are using to ensure they are compatible with Rails 5 and don't use any deprecated methods. If necessary, update or switch to a different library that is compatible with Rails 5.

MVC error when trying to add a new method to a Rails controller and access it through the routes file. The error message suggests that the method is missing a template for the request format and variant, and advises that if the request is for XHR/Ajax or API, it would normally respond with 204 No Content. The code snippet provided includes the creation of a new Rails app, creating a controller, defining a method, adding a route to the routes file, and attempting to access the route, resulting in the aforementioned error. The user also notes that placing the method in a helper controller instead of the main controller works fine, but seeks a deeper understanding of how MVC works in Rails.

Error starting server after upgrading to Ruby 2.4.0 and adding gem 'therubyracer' to Gemfile
It seems that the warning messages are related to the deprecation of the Fixnum and Bignum constants in Ruby 2.4, which may not be causing any issues with the current code.   However, the main error message "Expected string default value for '--jbuilder'; got true (boolean)" indicates that the "--jbuilder" option is expecting a string default value, but instead received a boolean value of true.   This could be caused by an issue with the Jbuilder gem or with how it is being used in the Rails application. It may be worth checking the gemfile and gem version compatibility, as well as the syntax of the command being run.   Alternatively, it may be possible to avoid this issue by explicitly passing a default string value for the "--jbuilder" option, such as "false" or an empty string.

Error: "Unable to convert unpermitted parameters to hash" after upgrading to Rails 5  Problem Description: After upgrading to Rails 5, the entire website is unusable and any page throws the error "Unable to convert unpermitted parameters to hash." The better errors gem shows an error regarding to #cause resetting while re-raise. This issue is not page specific and is happening throughout.   Gemfile: The relevant parts of the Gemfile include gems such as Rails 5, Bootstrap-sass, Devise, and Sidekiq, among others.   Error Logs: The error logs show an ActionView template error regarding unpermitted parameters, specifically in the template.rb file.   Solution: The issue may be due to strong parameters or ActiveRecord parameters failing to permit certain attributes. The solution may involve updating the strong parameters in the relevant controller or updating the database schema to permit certain attributes. Debugging tools such as Pry and byebug may also be helpful in resolving the issue.

Performance differences can often be due to how code is executed and how many times it is executed. In the first version, the partial is rendered for each event using an iterator loop. In the second version, the same partial is rendered using the collection option, which renders the partial only once for all events. This likely results in less overhead and faster performance.  It's important to consider performance when writing code, especially in high traffic applications. Other performance hits can include database queries, caching, and application architecture. Using tools like profiling and benchmarking can help identify and optimize slow code.

Rails is unable to locate the `MyMiddleWare` middleware. It seems that the middleware file `my_middle_ware.rb` may not have been properly loaded by Rails or the `MyMiddleWare` class is not defined within the file.   To fix this issue, ensure that the file containing the middleware has been properly loaded by Rails. This can be done by adding an explicit require statement in your application.rb file or by adding the middleware file to the autoload paths in the application.rb file.   Additionally, ensure that the `MyMiddleWare` class is defined within the middleware file and that it is correctly named with proper CamelCase conventions.

Error when passing search params to sorting link: unable to convert unpermitted parameters to hash. The code snippets provided suggest that the issue may be with the private method for sanitization, specifically with the merge function. One way to address this issue is to whitelist all search parameters in the private method by using the permit function. For example:  def sort_params   params.permit(:sort, :direction, :page, :startdate, :near, :radius, :min, :max) end  Then in the sortable method, replace params.merge with sort_params.  link_to title, sort_params.merge(sort: column, direction: direction, page: nil), class: css_class  This will ensure that all search parameters are permitted and merged correctly in the sorting links.

Fixing Rubocop Offenses in Gemfile  Problem Description: The library of ruby code generates several rubocop offenses in Gemfile. To rectify these offenses, modifications are required in the Gemfile.  Solution: Add a "frozen_string_literal" magic comment to the top of the Gemfile to make Rubocop not complain about the offense.   Code Snippet:  # frozen_string_literal: true source "https://rubygems.org"  # Rest of the code  By adding this magic comment to the top of the Gemfile, Rubocop will consider the entire file immutable and prevent any modification to it. This will ensure that the code behaves predictably and can be tested more easily.

How to Seed Active Storage Attachments in Rails Database?  One possible solution to this problem is to use the Rails `fixture_file_upload` helper method to generate and attach sample image files to your Active Storage attachments during the seeding process. Here's an updated version of your code snippet:  User.create(email: "test@ok.com", password: "okokok") if User.count.zero?  50.times do |i|   temp = Template.create(     title: Faker::Name.name,     description: Faker::Lorem.paragraph(2),     user: User.first,     github_link: Faker::SiliconValley.url,     category: rand(0...4)   )      puts "Attaching photo to template #{temp.id}..."      file = fixture_file_upload(Rails.root.join('spec', 'fixtures', 'files', 'image.jpg'), 'image/jpeg')      temp.photo.attach(io: file, filename: 'image.jpg', content_type: 'image/jpeg') end  In this example, we're using a sample image file called "image.jpg" located in the "spec/fixtures/files" directory of your Rails project. You can replace this with your own sample image file or generate one dynamically using the Faker gem.  The `fixture_file_upload` method returns an ActionDispatch::Http::UploadedFile instance that simulates a file upload request. We then attach this file to the `temp.photo` Active Storage attachment using the `attach` method and specifying the file's IO object, filename, and content type.  Finally, we print a message indicating the current progress of the seeding process, such as "Attaching photo to template 1...", "Attaching photo to template 2...", and so on.  This should allow you to seed your database with Active Storage attachments and ensure that they're properly associated with their respective records.
